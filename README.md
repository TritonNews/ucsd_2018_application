This project utilizes [UC data](http://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/content-analysis/ug-admissions/student-workforce-data.html) on applications to the UC for 2018 and the previous 5 years. A stacked bar chart of student application demographics is made [using holoviews](http://holoviews.org/) ([ipynb](https://github.com/TritonNews/ucsd_2018_application/blob/master/UCSD_Application_Data.ipynb)). A line chart of application number growth for the past five years is made using [plotly](https://plot.ly/~malelew/3/).
